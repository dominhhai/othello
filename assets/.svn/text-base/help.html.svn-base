<p>The goal of the game is to have more disks than your opponent at the 
end of the game.
You can do this by either placing new disks or flipping over the 
opponent's disks to your own color.
Flipping over a disc is done by placing a new disk on the board in a way
 that the opponent's disc or discs are enclosed by yours.
When placing a new disc, you have to place it in a way that it flips 
over at least one of your opponent's discs.
Sometimes you cannot place new discs, because there are no valid 
locations to place any. In this case, you have to pass, perhaps multiple
 times.
When the board is full and all 64 squares are occupied, or neither 
players have any valid moves left, the game ends.
The winner is the player who has the most disks.<br><br>
